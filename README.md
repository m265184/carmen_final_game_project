 This is my DodgeRacers game, where the objective is to drive and avoid the cars and spilled oil to prevent crashing. If you collect the gas cans, you get an extra point boost! It starts to get fast, so you can shoot the cars coming after you by clicking, but you won't get any points from shooting cars. Increase your score by passing the cars and collecting the gas cans. 
 This game includes:
 - Mouse functions
 - keyboard functions
 - sound effects and background music
 - score tracking
 - high score tracking between gameplays
 - trigonometry
 - projectiles
 - multiple screens
 - online-generated fonts
 - movement limits (car cannot go off the road)
 - a main menu
